I invite you to view this HR web application demo project deployed on Netlify:
<url to be added...>

This web application is using React hooks and the Ant Design component library. It was challenging due to the poorly written documentation, and I had to correct some buggy Ant Design functionality. I used the Ant Design library alongside npm packages like Babel, Webpack, Umi, Moment and React-Router.

The Home page showcases various Charts, aiming to visualize data of a given company.
The Form page uses many types of input, with relevant validation functionality. It is designed for entering data about a new or potential employee.
The Table page displays the existing employee data. Observe the fixed header, while you scroll along two axis. Behind the scene, it is a virtual table, so the cells are being added and deleted while they enter and leave the view. This is optimal for a lightweight experience in case of large tables with both many columns and high amount of data.
